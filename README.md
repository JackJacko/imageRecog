# imageRecog
This repo contains an API which stores users on a database and lets them identify what an image on the web contains by using Tensorflow and Inception v3. The API tracks the number of uses, up to a fixed number that can be refilled.

These files were created as exercises for the RESTful APIs, Flask, Docker, MONGOdb, and AWS course over at udemy.com
